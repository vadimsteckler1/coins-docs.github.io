# Public Rest API for Coins (2022-09-12)

## General API Information

* The base endpoint is: **https://api.pro.coins.ph**
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* Data is returned in **ascending** order. Oldest first, newest last.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds.

## HTTP Return Codes
* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for for malformed requests;the issue is on the sender's side.
* HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on exchange's side.It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is UNKNOWN and could have been a success.

## Error Codes
* Any endpoint can return an ERROR; the error payload is as follows:

```javascript
{
  "code": -1121,
  "msg": "Invalid symbol."
}
```

* Specific error codes and messages defined in another document.



## General Information on Endpoints

* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a
  `query string` or in the `request body` with content type
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the
  `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the
  `query string` parameter will be used.



### LIMITS

**General Info on Limits**

* intervalNum describes the amount of the interval. For example, intervalNum 5 with intervalLetter M means "Every 5 minutes".

* A 429 will be returned when either rate limit is violated.



### IP Limits

* Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
* When a 429 is recieved, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
* **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (http status 418).**
* IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.
* A `Retry-After` header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the **number of seconds**required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
* **The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.**



### Order Rate Limits

- When the order count exceeds the limit, you will receive a 429 error without the `Retry-After` header.

- The order rate limit is counted against each IP and UID.



### Websocket Limits

- A single connection can listen to a maximum of 1024 streams.



### /api/ Limit Introduction

- Endpoints related to `/api/*`:

  - According to the two modes of IP and UID limit, each are independent.

  - Endpoints share the 1200 per minute limit based on IP.



### Endpoint security type

* Each endpoint has a security type that determines the how you will interact with it.This is stated next to the NAME of the endpoint.
  - If no security type is stated, assume the security type is NONE.
* API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `X-COINS-APIKEY`header.
* API-keys and secret-keys **are case sensitive**.
* API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints.
  For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key can access everything except for TRADE routes.
* By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.

Security Type | Description
------------ | ------------
NONE | Endpoint can be accessed freely.
TRADE | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_STREAM | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.
MARKET_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.

* `TRADE` and `USER_DATA` endpoints are `SIGNED` endpoints.



### SIGNED (TRADE and USER_DATA) Endpoint security

* `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional parameter, `signature`, to be
  sent in the  `query string` or `request body`.
* Endpoints use `HMAC SHA256` signatures. The `HMAC SHA256 signature` is a keyed `HMAC SHA256` operation.
  Use your `secretKey` as the key and `totalParams` as the value for the HMAC operation.
* The `signature` is **not case sensitive**.
* `totalParams` is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the
  `request body`.



### Timing security

* A `SIGNED` endpoint also requires a parameter, `timestamp`, to be sent which
  should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
* An additional parameter, `recvWindow`, may be sent to specify the number of
  milliseconds after `timestamp` the request is valid for. If `recvWindow`
  is not sent, **it defaults to 5000**.
* The logic is as follows:

  ```javascript
  if (timestamp < (serverTime + 1000) && (serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow) {
    // process request
  } else {
    // reject request
  }
  ```

**Serious trading is about timing.** Networks can be unstable and unreliable,
which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the
servers. With `recvWindow`, you can specify that the request must be
processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the
server.

**It recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less!The max cannot go beyond 60,000!**



### SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /openapi/v1/order

Here is a step-by-step example of how to send a valid signed payload from the
Linux command line using `echo`, `openssl`, and `curl`.

```



#### Example 3: Mixed query string and request body

* **queryString:** symbol=ETHBTC&side=BUY&type=LIMIT&timeInForce=GTC
* **requestBody:** quantity=1&price=0.1&recvWindow=5000&timestamp=1538323200000

```

Note that the signature is different in example 3.
There is no & between "GTC" and "quantity=1".



## Public API Endpoints

### Terminology

These terms will be used throughout the documentation, so it is recommended especially for new users to read to help their understanding of the API.

* `base asset` refers to the asset that is the `quantity` of a symbol. For the symbol BTCUSDT, BTC would be the `base asset`.
* `quote asset` refers to the asset that is the `price` of a symbol. For the symbol BTCUSDT, USDT would be the `quote asset`.



### ENUM definitions

**Symbol status:**

* TRADING
* BREAK (ongoing)
* CANCEL_ONLY (ongoing)

**Order status:**

Status | Description
-----------| --------------
`NEW` | The order has been accepted by the engine.
`PARTIALLY_FILLED`| A part of the order has been filled.
`FILLED` | The order has been completed.
`PARTIALLY_CANCELED` | A part of the order has been cancelled with self trade.
`CANCELED` | The order has been canceled .
`REJECTED`       | The order was not accepted by the engine and not processed.

### Filters

Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange. Filters come in two forms: `symbol filters` and `exchange filters`.



#### Symbol filters

##### PRICE_FILTER

The `PRICE_FILTER` defines the `price` rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minPrice` defines the minimum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed.
* `maxPrice` defines the maximum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed.
* `tickSize` defines the intervals that a `price`/`stopPrice` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `price filter`, the following must be true for `price`/`stopPrice`:

* `price` >= `minPrice`
* `price` <= `maxPrice`
* (`price`-`minPrice`) % `tickSize` == 0

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PRICE_FILTER",
    "minPrice": "0.00000100",
    "maxPrice": "100000.00000000",
    "tickSize": "0.00000100"
  }
```



##### PERCENT_PRICE

The `PERCENT_PRICE` filter defines valid range for a price based on the weighted average of the previous trades. `avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the weighted average price is calculated over.

In order to pass the `percent price`, the following must be true for `price`:

- `price` <= `weightedAveragePrice` * `multiplierUp`
- `price` >= `weightedAveragePrice` * `multiplierDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE",
    "multiplierUp": "1.3000",
    "multiplierDown": "0.7000",
    "avgPriceMins": 5
  }
```



##### PERCENT_PRICE_SA

The `PERCENT_PRICE_SA` filter defines valid range for a price based on the  simple average of the previous trades. `avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the simple average price is calculated over.

In order to pass the `percent_price_sa`, the following must be true for `price`:

- `price` <= `simpleAveragePrice` * `multiplierUp`
- `price` >= `simpleAveragePrice` * `multiplierDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE_SA",
    "multiplierUp": "1.3000",
    "multiplierDown": "0.7000",
    "avgPriceMins": 5
  }
```



##### PERCENT_PRICE_BY_SIDE

The `PERCENT_PRICE_BY_SIDE` filter defines the valid range for the price based on the last price of the symbol.
There is a different range depending on whether the order is placed on the `BUY` side or the `SELL` side.

Buy orders will succeed on this filter if:

- `Order price` <= `bidMultiplierUp` * `lastPrice`
- `Order price` >= `bidMultiplierDown` * `lastPrice`

Sell orders will succeed on this filter if:

- `Order Price` <= `askMultiplierUp` * `lastPrice`
- `Order Price` >= `askMultiplierDown` * `lastPrice`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE_BY_SIDE",
    "bidMultiplierUp": "1.2",
    "bidMultiplierDown": "0.2",
    "askMultiplierUp": "1.5",
    "askMultiplierDown": "0.8",
  }
```



##### PERCENT_PRICE_INDEX

The `PERCENT_PRICE_INDEX` filter defines valid range for a price based on the  index price which is calculated based on  several exhanges in the market by centain rule. (indexPrice wobsocket pushing will be available in future)

In order to pass the `percent_price_index`, the following must be true for `price`:

- `price` <= `indexPrice` * `multiplierUp`
- `price` >= `indexPrice` * `multiplierDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE_INDEX",
    "multiplierUp": "1.3000",
    "multiplierDown": "0.7000",
  }
```



##### PERCENT_PRICE_ORDER_SIZE

The `PERCENT_PRICE_ORDER_SIZE` filter  is used to determine whether the execution of an order would cause the market price to fluctuate beyond the limit price, and if so, the order will be rejected.

In order to pass the `percent_price_order_size`, the following must be true:

- A buy order needs to meet: the market price after the order get filled  <`askPrice` * `multiplierUp`
- A sell order needs to meet: the market price after the order get filled  >`bidPrice` * `multiplierDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE_ORDER_SIZE",
    "multiplierUp": "1.3000",
    "multiplierDown": "0.7000"
  }
```



##### STATIC_PRICE_RANGE

The `STATIC_PRICE_RANGE` filter defines a static valid range for the price.

In order to pass the `static_price_range`, the following must be true for `price`:

- `price` <= `priceUp`
- `price` >= `priceDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "STATIC_PRICE_RANGE",
    "priceUp": "520",
    "priceDown": "160"
  }
```



##### LOT_SIZE

The `LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
* `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
* `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity`can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

* `quantity` >= `minQty`
* `quantity` <= `maxQty`
* (`quantity`-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "LOT_SIZE",
    "minQty": "0.00100000",
    "maxQty": "99999999.00000000",
    "stepSize": "0.00100000"
  }
```



##### NOTIONAL

The `NOTIONAL` filter defines the acceptable notional range allowed for an order on a symbol.

In order to pass this filter, the notional (`price * quantity`) has to pass the following conditions:

- `price * quantity` <= `maxNotional`
- `price * quantity` >= `minNotional`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
{
   "filterType": "NOTIONAL",
   "minNotional": "10.00000000",
   "maxNotional": "10000.00000000"
}
```



##### MAX_NUM_ORDERS

The `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
Note that both triggered "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ORDERS",
    "maxNumOrders": 200
  }
```



##### MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS

The `MAX_ALGO_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of untriggered "algo" orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
"Algo" orders are `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders.

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS",
    "maxNumAlgoOrders": 5
  }
```

Type | Additional mandatory parameters                  | Additional Information
------------ |--------------------------------------------------| ------------ 
`LIMIT` | `timeInForce`, `quantity`, `price`               |
`MARKET` | `quantity` or `quoteOrderQty`                    | `MARKET` orders using `quantity` field specifies the amount of the base asset the user wants to sell, E.g. `MARKET` order on BCHUSDT  will specify how much BCH the user is selling. <br />`MARKET` orders using `quoteOrderQty` field specifies the amount of the quote asset the user wants to buy, E.g. `MARKET` order on BCHUSDT  will specify how much USDT the user is buying.<br /> **It's not supported to use the `quantity` for buying or use  the  `quoteOrderQty` for selling  for now.**
`STOP_LOSS` | `quantity` or `quoteOrderQty`, `stopPrice`       | This will execute a `MARKET` order when`stopPrice` is met. Use `quantity` for selling, `quoteOrderQty` for buying.
`STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` | `timeInForce`, `quantity`,  `price`, `stopPrice` | This will execute a `LIMIT` order when`stopPrice` is met.
`TAKE_PROFIT` | `quantity` or `quoteOrderQty`, `stopPrice`            | This will execute a `MARKET` order when`stopPrice` is met. Use `quantity` for selling, `quoteOrderQty` for buying.
`TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` | `timeInForce`, `quantity`, `price`, `stopPrice`  | This will execute a `LIMIT` order when`stopPrice` is met.
`LIMIT_MAKER` | `quantity`, `price`                              | This is a `LIMIT` order that will be rejected if the order immediately matches and trades as a taker.

Trigger order price rules against market price for both MARKET and LIMIT versions:

* Price above market price: `STOP_LOSS/STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` `BUY`, `TAKE_PROFIT/TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` `SELL`
* Price below market price: `STOP_LOSS/STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` `SELL`, `TAKE_PROFIT/TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` `BUY`

## Merchant Endpoints

### Signature


**Common Headers**

The table below shows all of the common API Headers you will encounter in the Coins Access API.

Header Name | Required | Type | Example | Description
------------ |----------|--| ------------|--
X-Merchant-Key | YES   | STRING |     | The authorized merchant key
X-Merchant-Sign | YES | STRING |   | The authorized merchant request sign
X-Timestamp | YES | LONG  | 1671158910| Request initiation time
X-Trace-Id | NO | STRING |    |  Request log trace ID

To craft an X-Merchant-Sign:
1. Construct a message according to the following pseudo-grammar: ‘X-Timestamp’ +URL(http://127.0.0.1/merchant-api/account?paramKey=paramValue&paramKey2=paramValue2) + BODY(key1=value1&key=value2)
2. Calculate an HMAC with the message string you just created, your API secret as the key, and SHA256 as the hash algorithm

### Invoicing

An invoice is a document that outlines the details of a transaction between two parties, typically a seller and a buyer. The transaction could be for goods or services rendered, or it could be a transfer of funds from one user to another.

In an invoice, there are two main entities involved:

1) The payee, who is the recipient of the payment for the goods or services provided (the merchant).
2) The payer, who is the individual or organization making the payment to fulfill the invoice (the customer).

The API endpoints described in this section allow you to integrate invoicing functionality into your application. Creating, sending, and managing invoices directly from the application simplifies the invoicing process and improves the user experience.

#### Creating Invoices


```shell
POST /merchant-api/v1/invoices (HMAC SHA256)
```

This endpoint generates an invoice based on the provided parameters and returns a response with details of the created invoice.

**Weight:** 1

**Parameters:**

Name              | Type  | Mandatory | Description
-----------------|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
amount            | DECIMAL | YES       |The amount expected from the customer.
currency | STRING      | YES       | Currency of transaction.
supported_payment_collectors          | STRING  | YES       |Methods of payment that are available to a user when they view a payment request, e.g., ["coins_peso_wallet"]
external_transaction_id          | STRING  | YES       | To maintain transactional integrity, each transaction_id must be unique.
expires_at          | STRING  | NO        |The date and time at which the invoice will expire. This parameter accepts input in the ISO 8601 format for date and time, which is based on the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone (e.g., "2016-10-20T13:00:00.000000Z"). Alternatively, you can provide a time delta from the current time (e.g., "1w 3d 2h 32m 5s").

    }
}
```

### Invoice Callbacks

During the lifecycle of an invoice, various events may occur. For example, when an invoice is fully paid, the invoice.fully_paid event is triggered. These events can be tracked and acted upon using the Coins API's event system.

Merchants can specify a callback URL when creating or updating an invoice, which is a web address that the API will send event data to. When an event occurs, the API will send a POST request to the specified callback_URL, containing data about the event. The merchant can then process this data as needed, such as by updating their internal systems or notifying the customer.

To ensure that the events are delivered securely, merchants must include an authorization header with their Merchant API key in each POST request. This header, with the format Authorization: Token MERCHANT_APIKEY, confirms that the request is coming from a trusted source and provides an additional layer of security for the event data.

Event payloads follow this convention:
```javascript
{
  "event": {
    "name": "invoice.name",
    "data": {
        "id": "invoice_id",
        "currency": "PHP",
        "amount": "100",
        "amount_received": "0",
        "external_transaction_id": "1"
        }
    }
}
```

Events which may be consumed by callbacks are described in the table below:

Event Name	| Description
----|---
invoice.created	| The invoice has been created.
invoice.updated	| The invoice has been updated. This may be due to the payment received for the invoice.
invoice.fully_paid	| The invoice payment has been completed.
invoice.payment_reference_number_generated| The invoice payment reference number has been generated.
